# mult-expression-for-loop-c
C program playing with a for loop with multiple expressions.

One of the features of C is that a for loop---

---Usually  (x ; x< 10 ; x++ )---

Can have multiple expressions, thus;

( a, b, c, d ; a > 10, b < 10, c = a / b, d = a* b* c ) . . .

This program demonstrates and plays with this feature, and is completely documented.
